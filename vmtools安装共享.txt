1：创建挂载目录
  mkdir /mnt/cdrom --创建文件夹

2：挂载
mount /dev/sr0 /mnt/cdrom

3. 将VMware-tools压缩包复制至/opt/，并解压
cp /mnt/cdrom/VMwareTools-10.2.0-7259539.tar.gz /opt/
tar -zxvf VMwareTools-10.2.0-7259539.tar.gz

4. 切换到VMwareTools目录，执行VMware-tools安装命令
cd VmwareTools-10.2.0-7259539
./vmware-install.pl

这里如果没有编译环境会报错（bash: ./vmware-install.pl: /usr/bin/perl: bad interpreter: ......）。

则需要安装  yum install perl gcc kernel-devel  安装后。在运行安装文件./vmware-install.pl

有[yes] 直接输入yes, 没有的直接回车。只到出现了一个重复的问题。以下是安装日志。

Before you can compile modules, you need to have the following installed...

make
gcc
kernel headers of the running kernel


Searching for GCC...

The path "/bin/gcc" appears to be a valid path to the gcc binary.
Would you like to change it? [no] no

Searching for a valid kernel header path... --这里要输入刚刚安装的repl 的include
The path "" is not a valid path to the 3.10.0-957.el7.x86_64 kernel headers.
Would you like to change it? [yes] yes

Enter the path to the kernel header files for the 3.10.0-957.el7.x86_64

The filesystem driver (vmhgfs module) is used only for the shared folder 
feature. The rest of the software provided by VMware Tools is designed to work 
independently of this feature.

If you wish to have the shared folders feature, you can install the driver by 
running vmware-config-tools.pl again after making sure that gcc, binutils, make
and the kernel sources for your running kernel are installed on your machine. 
These packages are available on your distribution‘s installation CD.

后面yes 回车，输入即可，只到。


5. 安装完成后，执行df -h，显示如下信息表示安装成功
df -h
vmhgfs-fuse 197G 95G 103G 49% /mnt/hgfs
 
6. 若重启后，发现共享文件夹不显示，则检查vmware-tools服务是否没有启动，执行以下命令启动服务
service vmware-tools start
或者执行如下命令手工挂载
# 若vmhgfs-fuse -e执行成功时执行

挂载，-o参数比较重要，不然其他用户没权限读写
vmhgfs-fuse .host:/  /root/nginx/www/hgfs/  -o subtype=vmhgfs-fuse,allow_other

# mvhgfs-fuse -e 执行失败时执行
mount -f vmhgfs .host:/ /mnt/hgfs
